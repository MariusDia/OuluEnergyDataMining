#     Energy consumption data set       #


- Research question?
        - Yearly consumption + metadata:
                - Find out if the metadata explains the yearly consumption
                - which factors in metadata are imporant
                - old building -> high consumption etc.
        - Time series forecasting:
                - Hourly data
                - How accurately/how far ahead is it possible to forecast energy consumption
                - model single buildings (ids) OR groups of buildings (postal code areas / building types)
                - Neural networks, XGBoost, SVM, many models availble. Simple: ARIMA is classical time
                  series modelling.
        - Clustering patterns of consumption:
                - Ready made libraries such as k-means clustering etc.
                - Different buildings with similar weekly usage?
                - Different typical daily patterns among single ids or among many buildings?

- Next seminar:
        - Presenting the research question.
        - Why this research question? Describe the data to explain how it should be able to answer your
          questions.
        - Target 10 minutes. 

- Sharing work:
        - Nice practices: Should you have a project leader? Set deadlines for different steps.
        - Coding things: Loading data, preprocessing, visualization, data mining
        - Literature review
        - Writing
