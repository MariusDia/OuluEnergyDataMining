ROLES

    Marius
    - Function to retrieve hourly data done.
    - Data transformed into a pandas DataFrame, datetime column has been formed
      from the time related columns.
    - Average energy consumption (of all time) has been fetched for each id.
    - Energy consumption related to floor count of the building has been studied.
    - Plan: check missing data in each characteristic and see which ones are
      usable for analysis.
    
    Mari
    - Has checked on research and energy consumption related statistics.
    - Word project file created and shared.
    - Plan: Writing the report, literature review, introduction.
    - Sources for articles:
            - IEEE (check if journal article/conference paper)
            - ScienceDirect: Elsevier's (publisher) material
            - ResearchGate
    - Future recommendation: Overleaf for writing scientific text. Co-operative
      platform for LaTeX documents.
    
    Mussadaq
    - Has done initial studying of clustering methods/functions to use. k-means
      a potential choice.
    - A suggestion for "easy" start on clustering: cluster daily energy
      consumption profiles of one ID (building).
            -> get clusters of week days, summer days, weekend days?
    - Plan: form understanding of the data structure and perform clustering for
      energy consumption data.
    - Notes on data structure:
            - Time series data.
            - Time is x-axis, has to be collected from time related columns:
              year, day, month hour. (Done by Marius)
            - Consumption is the y-axis. 
            - If you choose data corresponding to ONE ID, you have the time
              series data of one building.
    
    Arttu
    - Has searched for some clustering tutorials.
    - Plan: Study the energy consumption on different districts. 



RESEARCH QUESTION
    - Plan is to do clustering along with studying the effect of building
      characteristics (including postal code area)
    - Researching building characteristics' effect on energy consumption creates
      understanding of the data, and allows interpretation of clustering
      results.

CHALLENGES
    - Missing data.
           - Note on this: If missing data mostly in buildings'
             characteristics, it might not be a big issue for clustering, since
             clustering might be done without using those features. 
    - Dividing roles: discuss and recheck that everyone's role is suitable.

OTHER NOTES
    - Hourly data is meaning for clustering. For researching the building
      characteristics however, monthly or even yearly consumption might be more
      relevant. Consider the choice of necessary time resolution!
